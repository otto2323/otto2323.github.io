Thank you for your visit! I am a doctoral student and researcher in the Department of Quantitative Political Science at Goethe University.  With an interdisciplinary approach drawing on political science, social psychology, and migration studies, I study comparative political behavior in majority–minority contexts in the West, focusing on how political actors and political violence shape intergroup attitudes.

My research seeks to understand the mechanisms that can improve intergroup relations, particularly through social identity. Rather than viewing identity only as a sense of belonging, I examine how individuals define and make meaning of their identity, and how these processes are influenced by political actors (e.g governments, religious and political elites) and political developments.

I use large-scale surveys and experimental and quasi experimental approaches to examine how government policies, religious elites, education, and extremist violence influence identity, intergroup relations, and political participation among Muslim immigrants and majority  communities. 

A list of my publications, working papers, and current projects is available under [Research and Publications](/publication.md/) section.
